/*
 * SCENARIO: A simple bank account ledger applies a series of transactions (deposits and withdrawals) and prints the final balance. The final balance is wrong. 
 * TASK: Use the VS Code Java debugger (or add System.out.println at each step) to trace the value of balance through every transaction. Find and fix the bug. 
 * EXPECTED OUTPUT:
 * Final balance: $1500.00
